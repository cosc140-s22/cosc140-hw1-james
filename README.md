## Homework feedback

 * How long did you spend on this homework?

 I spent around 1.0 hours on this homework, however this time could have varied greatly based on the amount of detail I wanted to implement.

 * What did you think about it?  What was good?  What could be improved?


 It was fun, I enjoyed it a lot. I wish there was a little more algorithm based thinking, however I think that's just the nature of HTML and CSS.
